hi

read my rentry for a more extended bio 

i'm usually above the benches at docks, safe server 1.

i don't cater to touch triggers unless it's regiment related.
i also would prefer if proship limit interaction at the very least. i'm uncomfortable with the label and those who associate with it

i won't hesitate to hide you if i think you're weird. sorry, nothing personal. ok? ok
