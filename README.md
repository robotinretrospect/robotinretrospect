hi

read my rentry for a more extended bio of me if you think i'm cool

i'm usually above the benches at docks, safe server 1

i don't cater to touch triggers sorry i really don't think you should be on pony town in the first place, seek help.
i also would prefer if proship limit interaction. while i could care less for ship discourse, i'm uncomfortable with the label and those who associate with it. unless you keep it to yourself and be sensible, then i kinda don't care if you do. lol

i won't hesitate to hide you if i think you're weird (like openly incestuous skins or again, generally weird or annoying). sorry, nothing personal. ok? ok

be my friend i like talking to people please talk to me blelele
