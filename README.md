hi

read my rentry for more info. pony town please fucking add a bio option. i don't need this account

i'm usually above the benches at docks, safe server 1. i'm almost always in my sona's skin, c.u.b.e, the pink haired robot, or romeo from minecraft storymode

would prefer if proship limit interaction. while i could care less for ship discourse, i'm mostly uncomfortable with the label..... unless you keep it to yourself and be a generally sensible person, then i kinda don't care if you interact. lol. though i won't hesitate to hide you if i think you're weird (like. openly incestuous skins or generally annoying). sorry, nothing personal. ok? ok

please be my friend! i love talking to people and i'm actively seeking new friends so hmu if we have a lot in common yay
